# Image-Based-Malware-Detection

The goal of this program was to convert malware and benign files into images and train a machine learning model to determine whether or not a given file was malware or benign. Another goal of the project was to apply more machine learning techniques than just using a convolutional neural network. This project utilizes both a CNN as well as a bidirectional LSTM in order to classify the images. By using seperate randomized training and validation data sets, and training and running the model multiple times, I have reached an average accuracy of 91.37%, which was 5-10% more accurate than using a CNN without BiLSTM. The next stage of this project is to attempt a similar experiment using transformers and to see if the accuracy increases over using the BiLSTM.
